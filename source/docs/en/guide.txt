Description:
The Accessible YouTube Downloader Pro is an advanced version of its predecessor, the Accessible YouTube Downloader. It's specifically designed to cater to the needs of visually impaired users of computers running the Windows operating system. The program offers a comprehensive and compatible user experience for the popular video hosting service, YouTube, by providing an easy-to-use interface that is suitable for screen readers. This is especially useful since there isn’t an official application for interacting with YouTube on the Windows operating system.

Using the Search and Browsing Feature
The "Search and Browse" functionality is one of the standout features that set this software apart from its lite version. You can access this feature in three straightforward ways:
Method 1:
1.
Activate the menu by pressing the 'Alt' key.
2.
Use the down arrow key until you highlight the 'Search on YouTube' option.
3.
Confirm your choice by pressing 'Enter'.
Method 2:
From the main interface, use the 'Tab' key to navigate. Once you find the 'Search on YouTube' button, press 'Enter'.
Method 3:
You can also quickly access the feature using the shortcut 'Control+F'.
Once inside the search interface, you'll find a search box. Here, you can type in titles or keywords of YouTube videos you're interested in. If you hit the 'Tab' key, a dropdown menu with various search filters will appear:
•
No Filter: This allows for a broad search without any restrictions.
•
Live Stream: Focuses the search results on live streaming videos.
•
Upload Date: Lists the results starting with the most recent uploads.
•
View Count: Displays videos with the highest views at the top.
•
Playlists: Restricts your search to only show playlist results.
Quick Tips:
•
Move within the dropdown using the arrow keys.
•
Using a filter is optional. If you prefer, just type in your search query and hit 'Enter' to see all relevant results.

Results Window:
The results interface displays a list of videos found based on the search query entered by the user in the search dialog. The results are presented as a list, and users can navigate through the items using arrow keys. To play a displayed video, first, select the video using the arrow keys, then press the 'Enter' key. If you wish to play the video as audio-only, press 'Control' along with the 'Enter' key. Optionally, you can also click the play button located next to the results list to view the clip.
Each search result has an associated options menu, accessible by hovering over a result and pressing the 'Application key' or 'Shift+F10'. This displays the context menu with the following choices:
•
Play: You can alternatively use the play methods mentioned above.
•
Play as Audio Clip: This plays the clip without showing the video on screen. Shortcut: 'Control + Space'.
•
Download: This option unfolds into a submenu with two items:
1.
Video: Downloads the clip in MP4 format.
2.
Audio: Another submenu listing available audio formats, namely M4A and MP3. Notably, M4A is faster and lighter than MP3.
•
Direct Download: Downloads the selected clip in the default format set in the settings. Shortcut after selecting a search result: 'Control+D'.
•

In addition to the results list, other options are available in the browser interface:
1.

2.

Browsing Playlists:
When using the search function with the 'Playlists' filter, the program narrows down the search results to playlists only. The playlist results page has the same properties as the video results interface. The only difference is the replacement of the play button with an open button, which displays the available videos in the playlist. Using the download feature in the playlist video view, the program saves the downloaded video to a folder dedicated to that playlist, making organization easier for the user.
 
Player Interface Overview:
The player interface appears when a user selects a search result to play or pastes a YouTube link for playback. This window is designed to cater to both visually impaired users and those with normal vision.

Keep in mind that the maximum increment is 10 seconds and the minimum is one second.
2.
Simultaneous Playback and Download: The software allows you to watch and download a clip simultaneously. If you open the clip options as described above and choose a download method, the download will commence while the clip is playing. You can easily switch between the video window and the download dialog using the Alt + Tab shortcut.
3.
Media Control Keys: You can use the media control keys on your computer to control the media player, such as play, pause, and navigate between clips, even if the application window is minimized.
 
YouTube Link Download Dialog Explanation:
There are three methods to access the YouTube link download dialog from the main program interface:
1.
Menu Navigation:
•
Press the menu button (Alt).
•
Navigate downwards using the down arrow to find the option "Download via Link."
•
Press the Enter key to select.
2.
Main Interface Navigation:
•
From the main interface, use the Tab key to locate a button labeled "Download via Link."
•
Activate it by pressing Enter.
3.
Shortcut Key:
•
Use the shortcut key Control+D (or its Arabic equivalent Control+ي).
Regardless of the method you used to access, you'll be in a download dialog which mirrors the interface of the "accessible YouTube downloader" lite version. Here, you can download various YouTube links including channels, playlists, and individual videos. Playlists and channels will be saved in a dedicated folder named after the channel or playlist.
The first field in this dialog is where you input the download link. The software will automatically recognize the link, eliminating the need for manual pasting. The next component lets you select the type of download – either audio or video. If you choose to download audio, the subsequent option will allow you to select the audio format, either m4a (faster option) or mp3. The next button, labeled "Download," starts the download process for the given link once you press Enter.
Note:
You can quickly change the download path directly from the download dialog using a dedicated button. It's essential to understand that the path chosen here will only apply to the current download and won't be saved in the program settings. If you wish to permanently change the default path, do it through the program settings, as explained earlier. The reason for including a path change option in this dialog is for users who might want to download specific content to a particular location for a one-time occurrence, without the hassle of altering the main settings. The default download folder for the program is titled "accessible YouTube downloader" located within the user's downloads folder.
 
Playing YouTube Links:
If you have a YouTube link for a specific video—perhaps one you received through communication means like email—and you wish to play it using the software to benefit from its built-in media player features, it's a straightforward process. Start the program and press the shortcut `control+y`. This will prompt a dialog box where you'll be asked to provide the video link and specify if you'd like to play it as audio or video. By default, the software will detect any copied link and automatically place it in the link field. When you play the video in this manner, you can utilize all the media player features of the software, as previously described. Furthermore, you'll also have the option to download the clip directly from within the player.
Favorites Video Interface:
The application offers a dedicated section where users can save certain videos, allowing quicker access for both viewing and downloading. This window bears a close resemblance to the search results window in terms of available options and helpful shortcut commands. The primary difference here is that the favorites window does not have a search button. Instead, it introduces a new button for removing the selected video from the favorites list. Alternatively, you can also use the `delete` key on your keyboard to perform the same task as the on-screen delete icon. It's worth noting that when playing a clip from the favorites list, the navigation keys will allow you to move between the other favorite clips on the list, rather than browsing through the search results.
